## JobSeeker is an app built for people to store information related to their job search.

### Problem:

As you enter the world of professional web developement, it may become difficult to track all of the jobs you've applied for and the contacts you've made. As your network grows, JobSeeker provides a place to store your potential job leads, different versions of your important documents, events you'd like to attend, and contacts.

### Target Users and Purpose:

JobSeeker provides a platform for... job seekers... to store information important to their search efforts.
